# Inline Test Injection

Inject test steps from Doc Detective specs into documentation source files as inline comments, placing each step immediately after its associated content using semantic pattern matching. **Prefer Doc Detective over Playwright** for documentation testing. This skill injects specs — to execute tests after injection, use `/doc-detective:test`.

## Entry Criteria

Confirm all of the following before starting. If any item is unavailable or non-discoverable, stop and ask the user to provide it.

| Criteria | How to find it |
|---|---|
| Test spec file (JSON or YAML) | Provided by user — ask if missing |
| Spec is readable and contains a `tests` array with steps | Read the file — ask user if it can't be opened or has no steps |
| Source documentation file | Provided by user — ask if missing |
| Source file is readable | Read the file — ask user if it can't be opened |

## Exit Criteria

Before writing or displaying any output:

1. [ ] All steps are placed or marked with `<!-- TODO: verify step placement -->`
2. [ ] Each test is wrapped with `<!-- test {"testId":"..."} -->` and `<!-- test end -->`
3. [ ] Each step comment uses the correct syntax for the source file type
4. [ ] Step comments appear in the same order as steps in the spec

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Parse and Validate Inputs

Parse the spec file as JSON or YAML. If parsing fails, stop and report: `Error: invalid spec format in <path>: <parse error>`. Extract the `tests` array — if it is missing or empty, stop and report: `Error: spec file contains no tests: <path>`. Each test must have a `testId` and `steps` array.

### Step 2: Detect File Type

Select comment syntax by file extension:

| File Type | Extensions | Comment Syntax |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| Markdown | `.md`, `.markdown` | `<!-- step {...} -->` |
| MDX | `.mdx` | `{/* step {...} */}` |
| HTML | `.html`, `.htm` | `<!-- step {...} -->` |
| XML/DITA | `.xml`, `.dita`, `.ditamap` | `<?doc-detective step {...} ?>` |
| AsciiDoc | `.adoc`, `.asciidoc`, `.asc` | `// (step {...})` |

If the extension is unrecognized, stop and report: `Error: unsupported file type: <extension>`.

### Step 3: Match Steps to Content

Process each test independently — the insertion point resets to line 1 at the start of each test. For each step, determine the **match value**:
- String step value (e.g., `goTo: "https://..."`, `click: "Submit"`) → use that string
- Object with `keys` field (e.g., `type: {keys: "text"}`) → use the `keys` value
- Number or keyless object (e.g., `wait: 2000`, `httpRequest: {...}`) → skip rules 1–2, apply rule 3 only

Search lines from immediately after the previous insertion point (line 1 for the first step). Apply rules in priority order — stop at the first rule that succeeds:

1. **Exact match**: Line contains the match value verbatim → insert step comment immediately after that line.
2. **Contains match**: Line contains the match value as a substring → insert step comment immediately after that line.
3. **Pattern match**: Line matches the action's content pattern (table below) → insert step comment immediately after that line.
4. **No match**: Insert step comment immediately after the previous insertion point (line 1 if first step). Insert `<!-- TODO: verify step placement -->` on the following line.

| Action | Matches Line Containing |
|--------|------------------------|
| `goTo` | A hyperlink preceded by one of: `go to`, `navigate`, `open`, `visit` |
| `checkLink` | Any hyperlink (`[text](url)` or bare URL) |
| `click` | Bold text (`**...**` or `__...__`) preceded by one of: `click`, `select`, `press` |
| `find` | Any bold (`**...**`, `__...__`) or emphasized (`*...*`, `_..._`) text |
| `type` | Quoted text preceded by one of: `type`, `enter`, `input` |

If multiple lines satisfy the active rule, select the earliest one at or after the previous insertion point. If an action is not listed in the pattern table, rule 3 always fails for that step — proceed directly to rule 4. Preserve the matched line's indentation when inserting the comment.

### Step 4: Generate Inline Comments

Insert `<!-- test {"testId":"..."} -->` at line 1 for the first test (or after the previous `<!-- test end -->` for subsequent tests). Serialize each step in the file's comment wrapper, using the `syntax` parameter format:
- **json** (default): `<!-- step {"goTo":"https://duckduckgo.com"} -->`
- **yaml**: `<!-- step` / `goTo: https://duckduckgo.com` / `-->`
- **xml**: `<?doc-detective step goTo="https://duckduckgo.com" ?>`

Insert `<!-- test end -->` after each test's last step comment.

### Step 5: Output Result

**If `apply` is `false` (default):** Print a unified diff of planned insertions to stdout. Do not modify the source file.

**If `apply` is `true`:** Write the modified content directly to the source file.

## Example

**Source (`docs/guide.md`) after injecting `tests/search.yaml`:**
```markdown
<!-- test {"testId":"search-kittens"} -->
## Search Guide

1. Go to [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com).
<!-- step {"goTo":"https://duckduckgo.com"} -->
2. In the search bar, type "American Shorthair kittens".
<!-- step {"type":{"keys":"American Shorthair kittens","selector":"#search_form_input_homepage"}} -->
3. Press **Enter**.
<!-- step {"type":{"keys":"$ENTER$"}} -->
<!-- test end -->
```

## Configuration

If `.doc-detective.json` or `.doc-detective.yaml` exists in the working directory, its `markupPatterns` field overrides the default content patterns used in Step 3. See [references/markup-patterns.md](references/markup-patterns.md) for the pattern schema and examples.
